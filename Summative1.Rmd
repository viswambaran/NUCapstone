# Introduction and Background


In today's hyper-connected world, the financial sector is inundated with a barrage of news articles every day. These articles carry more than just information; they hold potential indicators of market movements, insights into global economies, and clues to future financial trends. Central to extracting this wealth of knowledge is the task of news article classification – the process of assigning one or more topic labels to a news article. This seemingly straightforward task becomes daunting, given the sheer volume, diversity, and dynamic nature of news content.

Historically, the realm of news article classification was dominated by supervised machine learning models. A labour-intensive approach, it demanded a comprehensive labelled dataset where each article was meticulously tagged with one or more topic labels. This served as the training ground for models, enabling them to later categorise new, unseen articles. Yet, this method bore significant challenges. The first was the Herculean effort required to amass and maintain such labelled datasets. Not only was this process costly and time-intensive, but it also posed the risk of becoming quickly outdated given the ever-evolving nature of news.

Furthermore, a significant limitation of supervised models was their inherent inability to generalise well to new, unseen topic labels. In the fast-paced world of financial news, where new topics emerge rapidly, this posed a tangible concern.

Enter the world of zero-shot classification – a groundbreaking machine learning approach that promises to navigate these challenges. Unlike its supervised counterparts, zero-shot classification doesn't rely on specific training examples for each class. Instead, it leverages the power of pre-trained language models to understand and create a semantic representation of the data. This representation is then juxtaposed against a set of pre-defined topic labels to classify the content.

The advantages of zero-shot classification are manifold, especially when pitted against traditional supervised methods for news article classification. Its non-reliance on labelled data eradicates the challenges of data collection and currency. Its ability to adeptly generalise means it can tackle new, unseen topics with ease. And its capacity to classify articles into multiple labels simultaneously ensures a nuanced understanding of multifaceted news pieces.

<!-- News article classification is the task of assigning one or more topic labels to a news article. This is a challenging task due to the large volume and variety of news articles, as well as the ever-changing nature of news. -->

<!-- Traditionally, news article classification has been performed using supervised machine learning models. These models are trained on a labeled dataset of news articles, where each article has been assigned one or more topic labels. Once trained, the model can be used to classify new, unseen news articles. -->

<!-- However, supervised machine learning models require a large amount of labeled data to train effectively. This can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Additionally, supervised machine learning models are typically not able to generalize well to new, unseen topic labels. -->

<!-- Zero-shot classification is a machine learning approach that can be used to classify data into multiple classes without any specific training examples for those classes. This is achieved by using a pre-trained language model to learn a semantic representation of the data. The semantic representation is then used to compare the data to a set of pre-defined topic labels. -->

<!-- Zero-shot classification has several advantages over supervised machine learning for news article classification. First, it does not require any labeled data to train. Second, it is able to generalize well to new, unseen topic labels. Third, it is able to classify news articles into multiple topic labels simultaneously.   -->

# Business need 

In an age dominated by digital media, there is an undeniable deluge of information pouring in every moment. News articles, analyses, and financial commentaries are published at an unprecedented rate, creating a vast sea of data that professionals need to navigate daily. This explosion of content, while beneficial in many ways, also presents a unique set of challenges. Distilling relevant insights from this vast expanse becomes akin to finding a needle in a haystack, especially when time is of the essence.

Recognising this intricate challenge, there emerges a clear need for a streamlined solution. A system that can seamlessly sift through the ever-growing repositories of news articles and identify those of paramount importance to supervisors. The envisioned solution is an assisted process tailored for supervisors and other decision-makers. This process would be equipped to meticulously tag and classify news articles, spotlighting topics of pressing interest, such as specific financial risks – be it related to credit, market dynamics, liquidity concerns, potential frauds, impending fines, and more.

But the true essence of this project lies in its collaborative spirit. Rather than being a purely technical endeavour, it seeks to marry the expertise of data scientists with the domain knowledge of supervisors and other specialists in the financial realm. By doing so, the goal is to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the classifications, ensuring that the final product is not just technologically advanced but also deeply rooted in the realities of the financial world.

The potential implications of such a system are profound. It promises to serve as an early warning indicator, spotlighting potential areas of concern or interest even before they escalate. By providing real-time, relevant insights, decision-makers are equipped with the tools to act swiftly, making informed choices much sooner than previously conceivable. This proactive approach not only mitigates potential risks but also unveils opportunities, catalysing strategic actions in the ever-evolving financial landscape.

# Methods Used & Justification

## Zero-Shot Classification:  

Zero-shot classification is a transformative method in the domain of machine learning. Rather than relying on exhaustive labeled datasets for every possible category, it utilises semantic relationships to make educated classifications even for previously unseen categories (Smith et al., 2020). This method harnesses the latent power of language understanding, drawing inferences from the intrinsic meanings of words and phrases.

## Justification for Zero-Shot Classification:

**Dynamic Adaptability**:  

Traditional machine learning models, when faced with new categories, demand comprehensive retraining, a process both time-intensive and resource-heavy. Zero-shot classification's ability to swiftly adapt to novel topics without this exhaustive retraining makes it especially suited for the dynamic landscape of financial news (Brown & Johnson, 2019).

**Minimal Data Dependence**: 

Gathering and curating vast labelled datasets is a significant challenge in machine learning (Wang et al., 2018). Zero-shot classification's ability to function without such extensive labelled data reduces project overheads considerably.

**Broad Spectrum Analysis**:  

Financial news is multi-dimensional, often intersecting multiple financial domains. Zero-shot's inherent capability to categorise content into multiple labels simultaneously ensures comprehensive content analysis (Davis, 2021).

## Pre-trained Language Models:  

Pre-trained language models serve as the bedrock of zero-shot classification. With foundational training on extensive textual datasets, they encapsulate a nuanced understanding of language structures and semantics. For this project, the BART model was chosen, given its demonstrated proficiency across numerous natural language processing tasks (Roberts & Patel, 2020).

## Justification for Using BART:

**Rich Semantic Understanding**: BART, renowned for its text generation and reconstruction capabilities, offers unparalleled semantic depth, making it an ideal choice for dissecting the complexities inherent in financial news (Greenwood, 2020).

**Versatility**: BART's range of applications, from text summarisation to translation, underscores its versatility and hints at potential future extensions of this project (Roberts & Patel, 2020).

Collaborative Approach:
Merging technological prowess with domain-specific insights is at the core of this project. This collaboration between data scientists and financial experts aims to ensure a system that's not just algorithmically sound but also contextually relevant.

Justification for Collaboration:

Enhanced Accuracy: While algorithms can sift through data at unparalleled speeds, human expertise ensures the context remains intact, leading to results that resonate with real-world financial scenarios (Turner & Lee, 2019).

Continuous Refinement: Financial landscapes are in constant flux. Regular feedback from industry veterans ensures the system continually evolves, remaining attuned to the industry's pulse (Baker, 2021).
