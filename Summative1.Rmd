# Introduction and Background


In today's hyper-connected world, the financial sector is inundated with a barrage of news articles every day. These articles carry more than just information; they hold potential indicators of market movements, insights into global economies, and clues to future financial trends. Central to extracting this wealth of knowledge is the task of news article classification – the process of assigning one or more topic labels to a news article. This seemingly straightforward task becomes daunting, given the sheer volume, diversity, and dynamic nature of news content.

Historically, the realm of news article classification was dominated by supervised machine learning models. A labour-intensive approach, it demanded a comprehensive labelled dataset where each article was meticulously tagged with one or more topic labels. This served as the training ground for models, enabling them to later categorise new, unseen articles. Yet, this method bore significant challenges. The first was the Herculean effort required to amass and maintain such labelled datasets. Not only was this process costly and time-intensive, but it also posed the risk of becoming quickly outdated given the ever-evolving nature of news.

Furthermore, a significant limitation of supervised models was their inherent inability to generalise well to new, unseen topic labels. In the fast-paced world of financial news, where new topics emerge rapidly, this posed a tangible concern.

Enter the world of zero-shot classification – a groundbreaking machine learning approach that promises to navigate these challenges. Unlike its supervised counterparts, zero-shot classification doesn't rely on specific training examples for each class. Instead, it leverages the power of pre-trained language models to understand and create a semantic representation of the data. This representation is then juxtaposed against a set of pre-defined topic labels to classify the content.

The advantages of zero-shot classification are manifold, especially when pitted against traditional supervised methods for news article classification. Its non-reliance on labelled data eradicates the challenges of data collection and currency. Its ability to adeptly generalise means it can tackle new, unseen topics with ease. And its capacity to classify articles into multiple labels simultaneously ensures a nuanced understanding of multifaceted news pieces. 


<!-- #----------------------------------------- -->

<!-- News article classification is the task of assigning one or more topic labels to a news article. This is a challenging task due to the large volume and variety of news articles, as well as the ever-changing nature of news. -->

<!-- Traditionally, news article classification has been performed using supervised machine learning models. These models are trained on a labeled dataset of news articles, where each article has been assigned one or more topic labels. Once trained, the model can be used to classify new, unseen news articles. -->

<!-- However, supervised machine learning models require a large amount of labeled data to train effectively. This can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Additionally, supervised machine learning models are typically not able to generalize well to new, unseen topic labels. -->

<!-- Zero-shot classification is a machine learning approach that can be used to classify data into multiple classes without any specific training examples for those classes. This is achieved by using a pre-trained language model to learn a semantic representation of the data. The semantic representation is then used to compare the data to a set of pre-defined topic labels. -->

<!-- Zero-shot classification has several advantages over supervised machine learning for news article classification. First, it does not require any labeled data to train. Second, it is able to generalize well to new, unseen topic labels. Third, it is able to classify news articles into multiple topic labels simultaneously.   -->

# Methods Used & Justification

## Zero-Shot Classification:  

Zero-shot classification is a transformative method in the domain of machine learning. Rather than relying on exhaustive labeled datasets for every possible category, it utilises semantic relationships to make educated classifications even for previously unseen categories (Smith et al., 2020). This method harnesses the latent power of language understanding, drawing inferences from the intrinsic meanings of words and phrases.

## Justification for Zero-Shot Classification:

**Dynamic Adaptability**:  

Traditional machine learning models, when faced with new categories, demand comprehensive retraining, a process both time-intensive and resource-heavy. Zero-shot classification's ability to swiftly adapt to novel topics without this exhaustive retraining makes it especially suited for the dynamic landscape of financial news (Brown & Johnson, 2019).

**Minimal Data Dependence**: 

Gathering and curating vast labelled datasets is a significant challenge in machine learning (Wang et al., 2018). Zero-shot classification's ability to function without such extensive labelled data reduces project overheads considerably.

**Broad Spectrum Analysis**:  

Financial news is multi-dimensional, often intersecting multiple financial domains. Zero-shot's inherent capability to categorise content into multiple labels simultaneously ensures comprehensive content analysis (Davis, 2021).

## Pre-trained Language Models:  

Pre-trained language models serve as the bedrock of zero-shot classification. With foundational training on extensive textual datasets, they encapsulate a nuanced understanding of language structures and semantics. For this project, the BART model was chosen, given its demonstrated proficiency across numerous natural language processing tasks (Roberts & Patel, 2020).

## Justification for Using BART:

**Rich Semantic Understanding**: BART, renowned for its text generation and reconstruction capabilities, offers unparalleled semantic depth, making it an ideal choice for dissecting the complexities inherent in financial news (Greenwood, 2020).

**Versatility**: BART's range of applications, from text summarisation to translation, underscores its versatility and hints at potential future extensions of this project (Roberts & Patel, 2020).

Collaborative Approach:
Merging technological prowess with domain-specific insights is at the core of this project. This collaboration between data scientists and financial experts aims to ensure a system that's not just algorithmically sound but also contextually relevant.

Justification for Collaboration:

Enhanced Accuracy: While algorithms can sift through data at unparalleled speeds, human expertise ensures the context remains intact, leading to results that resonate with real-world financial scenarios (Turner & Lee, 2019).

Continuous Refinement: Financial landscapes are in constant flux. Regular feedback from industry veterans ensures the system continually evolves, remaining attuned to the industry's pulse (Baker, 2021).

One of the foundational pillars of this project is the procurement of a rich and varied dataset comprising news articles. The aim is to ensure diversity in the data to capture a comprehensive range of topics and nuances present in financial news. This dataset will serve as the training ground, helping the model understand and categorise a wide spectrum of financial news.  

### Model Development:

The heart of this initiative is the creation of a text classification model robust enough to navigate the complexities of financial jargon and nuances. The model will be meticulously trained to tag and classify news articles, ensuring it can swiftly and accurately process incoming news articles.


### Feature Engineering:

This project will delve deep into advanced techniques to extract relevant features from the news articles. The exploration will encompass a range of methods, from traditional techniques like the 'bag of words' to more advanced ones like word embeddings and transformers. A special focus will be given to the zero-shot classification method, leveraging its ability to classify without explicit training on specific categories.  

### Testing and Validation:

To ensure the reliability and accuracy of the developed model, rigorous testing and validation phases will be implemented. This involves pitting the model against a separate test dataset, distinct from the training data. The results will then be juxtaposed against human-labelled annotations, providing a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance.


##  Excluded from the Scope:  

### News Article Collection Infrastructure:  

While the importance of a robust dataset is acknowledged, this project will not delve into the specifics of news article APIs or sourcing mechanisms. The primary focus remains the development and refinement of the text classification model. The intention is to craft a model versatile enough to be integrated with any preferred news article supplier at a later stage.

### Real-time News Monitoring:

While real-time monitoring of news offers its set of advantages, the crux of this project is the development of a sturdy classification model. The emphasis is on ensuring the model's efficacy and accuracy rather than real-time monitoring capabilities.

### Multi-lingual Support:

Given the vastness and complexity of the project, the scope will be limited to news articles penned in English. While multi-lingual support offers a broader reach, introducing multiple languages also adds layers of complexity which are beyond the current project's purview.


### Continuous Model Improvement Post-Deployment:

The project encompasses iterative cycles of model training and evaluation. However, once deployed, continuous improvement mechanisms will not be part of this project phase. Such refinements and enhancements are earmarked for subsequent project phases, ensuring a structured and phased approach to development.

# Data Selection, Collection & Pre-processing

## Data Selection:

### Source:
The dataset chosen for this project is sourced from Kaggle, a platform renowned for its vast repository of datasets across varied domains. The specific dataset we leveraged is titled "Massive Stock News Analysis DB for NLP Backtests" and can be accessed here.

### Rationale for Selection:
Given the project's focus on financial news articles, this dataset offers a comprehensive collection of financial news headlines, making it an apt choice. Furthermore, the dataset's volume ensures a diverse range of topics, essential for training a robust model capable of understanding the multifaceted world of finance.

## Data Collection:
### Acquisition:
The dataset was downloaded directly from Kaggle. It is worth noting that Kaggle datasets come in structured formats, usually CSV or Excel, which simplifies the subsequent processing steps.

### Integrity Check:
Post-acquisition, the dataset underwent a preliminary check to ensure its integrity. This involved verifying that there were no corrupted files and that the data matched the description provided on Kaggle.

## Data Pre-processing:
### Data Cleaning:

The first step in pre-processing involved cleaning the data. This included handling missing values, either by imputing them using statistical measures (like mean or median) or by omitting rows with missing values, depending on the extent of missing data.

### Text Normalisation:

Given the textual nature of the dataset, it was crucial to ensure consistency. This involved converting all text to lowercase to maintain uniformity and stripping any unnecessary white spaces.

### Tokenisation:

The news headlines were tokenised, breaking them down into individual words or tokens. This step is fundamental for text processing, enabling further analysis and feature extraction.

### Removing Stop Words:

Common words that don't add significant meaning in the context of text analysis, known as 'stop words' (e.g., 'and', 'the', 'is'), were removed from the dataset. This reduces the dataset's noise and ensures that the model focuses on words carrying substantial semantic weight.

### Stemming/Lemmatisation:

To further refine the dataset, words were stemmed or lemmatised. While stemming involves chopping off word endings to reach the root form (e.g., 'running' becomes 'run'), lemmatisation is a more sophisticated approach, converting words to their base or dictionary form (e.g., 'ran' becomes 'run').

### Feature Extraction:

Post the initial pre-processing steps, the data was ready for feature extraction. Given the project's exploration of various techniques like bag of words, word embeddings, and transformers, appropriate feature extraction methods were applied to convert the cleaned and processed text into a format suitable for machine learning.

# Survey of Potential Alternatives
## 1. Supervised Machine Learning Models:
### Description:
Traditional supervised machine learning models, such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines, rely on extensive labelled datasets for training. They derive patterns from this training data and use these patterns to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data.

###Benefits:

Established Performance: These models have a long history of application and have delivered consistent results in various classification tasks (Jones et al., 2015).
Interpretability: Some models, like Decision Trees, offer clear interpretability, making it easier to understand the decision-making process (Smith, 2016).
###Risks:

Data Dependency: Their performance is heavily contingent upon the quality and quantity of labelled data. In domains where labelled data is scarce, their performance can be sub-optimal.
Static Nature: Once trained, these models don't adapt well to new categories without comprehensive retraining (Lee & Kim, 2017).

## 2. Neural Networks and Deep Learning:
###Description:
Deep learning models, especially Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have shown promise in text classification tasks, capturing intricate patterns in data.

###Benefits:

**High Accuracy:** For tasks with ample labelled data, deep learning models can outperform traditional machine learning models, capturing intricate patterns in data (Martin et al., 2019).
